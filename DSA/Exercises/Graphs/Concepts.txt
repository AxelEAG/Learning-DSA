In graphs, a vertex’s degree tells you how many edges touch it.
    Undirected graphs: degree is the number of incident edges.
    Directed graphs: 
        in-degree: number of incoming edges
        out-degree: number of outgoing edges

Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) are a fundamental concept in graph theory and algorithms. 
In a directed graph, a Strongly Connected Component is a subset of vertices where every vertex in 
the subset is reachable from every other vertex in the same subset by traversing the directed edges.
